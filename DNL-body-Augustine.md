# Augustine's Theology of the Flesh: <br>A Complex Perspective on the Body

Augustine, a prominent figure in Christian theology, believed in the importance of mastering the body as part of his doctrine of moral and spiritual development. He argued that the human condition was inherently flawed due to the inheritance of original sin from Adam and Eve. To overcome these sinful tendencies and draw closer to God, Augustine stressed the need for self-discipline and the mastery of one's bodily desires and impulses. He saw the body as a source of temptation and distraction, capable of leading individuals astray from the path of righteousness. 

Augustine acknowledges the conflict between the will and the flesh, where sexual desire (libido) is seen as one of the prime examples of the body's disobedience to the rational soul. He observes that the involuntary nature of sexual arousal, such as an erection, exemplifies the "rebelling flesh" that acts independently of the individual's rational will. This phenomenon creates an internal tension within individuals, as they find themselves subject to bodily responses that they cannot fully control.

Augustine's teachings emphasized that through self-control, chastity, and the subjugation of physical desires, one could achieve a closer connection to God, purify the soul, and attain salvation. But
In contrast to Pelagius, who upheld the inherent goodness of human nature and the capacity for self-improvement and salvation through personal endeavors, Augustine contends that while self-discipline and moral effort are important, they alone are insufficient for salvation. He believes that human nature is deeply flawed due to original sin, making it impossible for individuals to achieve salvation through their own efforts alone. The fallen human will, tainted by sin, requires the transformative power of divine grace to be able to choose and pursue the path of righteousness.

In this context, Augustine's view on self-discipline complements his belief in divine grace. Self-discipline, for Augustine, is a means to prepare the soul for the reception of God's grace. By exercising self-control and striving for virtuous living, individuals create a fertile ground for God's grace to work within them, aiding in their spiritual transformation and eventual salvation.

However Augustine's views on the body do not inherently consider the body as something intrinsically evil. Augustine, after a period of involvement with Manichaeism, converted to Christianity. Manichaeism, on the other hand, was a religious and philosophical system founded by Mani, which had a dualistic view of the world : the universe was seen as a battleground between the forces of light and darkness, Manichaeans believed that the human soul was divine but ensnared in the physical body, which they saw as inherently evil.  Instead, Augustine's perspective is more nuanced, where the body itself is not evil, but rather susceptible to being influenced by sinful desires and impulses. Augustine's understanding of the body is rooted in his concept of original sin, which posits that all humans inherit a fallen nature due to the sin of Adam and Eve. This fallen nature means that the body can be a source of temptation and moral struggle, as it is prone to desires that may lead individuals away from the path of righteousness.

But Augustine also recognizes that the body can be a vessel for good when it is used in accordance with God's will. He believed that God created the human body, and it is a fundamental part of our existence. The body can be a tool for virtuous actions, love, and service to others when guided by the moral and spiritual principles of Christianity. So, Augustine's perspective on the body is not one of inherent evil but rather a recognition of its vulnerability to sinful tendencies.
